# MechaCarChallenge
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to analyze manufacturing data for AutosRU's newest prototype the MechaCar. The project is examined in terms of three deliverables. The first is a multi-variate regression that examined how miles per gallon is affected by several other variables. The second deliverable was two tables of summary statistics, and the third deliverable was conducting several t-tests to determine the relationship between the sample and population means. Finally this project concludes with insights on possible statistical analysis that could be useful for AutosRU's team to compare the MechaCar to the cars of competitors. 

## Deliverable One - Linear Regression to Predict MPG
